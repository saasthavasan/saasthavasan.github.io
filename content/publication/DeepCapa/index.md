# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: DeepCapa is an automated post-detection framework that identifies and maps potentially malicious capabilities in malware to the code that implements these capabilities. It proposes a novel feature engineering approach that statically extracts API-call sequences from multiple memory snapshots taken during a sampleâ€™s dynamic execution. This approach allows for more comprehensive code coverage and effectively counters anti-sandbox techniques. Deepcapa also proposes a neural network architecture to not only accurately detects capabilities but also provide interpretable detections.
