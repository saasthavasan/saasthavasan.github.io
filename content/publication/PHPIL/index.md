abstract: We aim to fuzz the PHP interpreter to search for bugs which may or may not be able to compromise the security of the interpreter and the system it is running on. In our research we propose to implement a fuzzing framework for the standard implementation of the PHP interpreter. What makes our fuzzer different from other PHP interpreter fuzzers is its ability to create syntactically and semantically correct code samples. We found in our research that most of the available PHP interpreter fuzzers, although able to create syntactically correct code samples, are unable to produce semantic correctness. We created our own intermediate language composed of custom opcodes, which is used by the code generator to generate the code samples. Code generator is governed by the rules which make sure that the resulting code follows the PHP syntax and symmetric conventions. The mutator is driven by the code generator and it performs the mutation on the generated intermediate language. We created a corpus which is used to store the desired code samples on which further mutations can be performed. Thus new inputs are generated by performing mutations to the code which increases the coverage, thus maximizing the chances of finding vulnerabilities. The lifter lifts the mutated intermediate language sample to the php code before feeding to the interpreter. The execution of the php code sample is monitored for any unexpected behaviour of the interpreter. A report is formed in case of any unexpected behaviour.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: we propose PHPIL a fuzzing framework to find potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the PHP interpreter. Unlike previous work PHPIL generates both syntactically and semantically correct PHP code samples, using an intermediate language composed of custom opcodes. The code generator, governed by rules ensuring PHP syntax and conventions, drives the mutator to perform mutations on the generated intermediate language. These mutated samples are then lifted to PHP code, executed, and monitored for any unexpected behavior, with a report generated if any anomalies are detected.
